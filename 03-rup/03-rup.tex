\subsection{Complexity}
\sdPlush[4]{
  \sdBanner{It must be simple}\par
  \small
  ``We should make the smallest possible \ul{investment} in the design before getting payback for it'' -- Kent Beck\par
  ``A design contains \ul{needless complexity} when it contains elements that aren't currently useful. This frequently happens when developers anticipate changes to the requirements, and put facilities in the software to deal with those potential changes.'' -- Robert Martin\par
  ``Our failure to master the complexity of software results in projects that are late, over budget, and deficient in their stated requirements. We often call this condition the \ul{software crisis}, but frankly, a malady that has carried on this long must be called normal.'' -- \nospell{Grady Booch}

}

\sdPlush[3]{
  ``The main virtue of an architect is the ability to \ul{reduce complexity}. Thus, a good architect would never be proud of a complex diagram. Instead, they would be proud of a simple and easy-to-understand drawing with a few rectangles that perfectly explain an entire multi-tier application. That is what is really difficult to do. That's where a true architectural mind shines.'' --- me.\par
  \sdQR{https://www.yegor256.com/2015/06/29/simple-diagrams.html}
}

\subsection{Duplication}
\sdPlush[3]{
  \sdBanner{It must not repeat itself}\par
  ``When there is \ul{redundant code} in the system, the job of changing the system can become arduous. Bugs found in such a repeating unit have to be fixed in every repetition. However, since each repetition is slightly different from every other, the fix is not always the same.'' -- Robert Martin
}

\subsection{Immobility}
\sdPlush[3]{
  \sdBanner{It must be modular}
  ``A design is \ul{immobile} when it contains parts that could be useful in other systems, but the effort and risk involved with separating those parts from the original system are too great.'' -- Robert Martin\par
  ``A design is rigid if a single change causes a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules. The more modules that must be changed, the more \ul{rigid} the design.'' -- Robert Martin
