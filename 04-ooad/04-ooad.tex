Sterile procedure is what makes surgery possible. Without it, the risk of infection would be far too high to tolerate. Agile developers feel the same way about their designs.}{Agile Software Development. Principles, Patterns, and Practices \br Robert Martin}}

  ``If for each object $o_1$ of type $S$ there is an object $o_2$ of type $T$ such that for all programs $P$ defined in terms of $T$, the behavior of $P$ is unchanged when $o_1$ is substituted for $o_2$ then $S$ is a subtype of $T$.'' --- Barbara Liskov
