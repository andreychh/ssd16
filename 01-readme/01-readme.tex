\section[RUP]{SAD at RUP}

\plush[4]{\innoCite{books/rup}{The main responsibility of the architect is to describe the architecture of the system in a major artifact of the RUP product, called the \ul{Software Architecture Document (SAD)}. For many projects, this may be the only part of the design that is described in an actual document, as most design aspects can be documented in UML models and in the code itself.}{The Rational Unified Process Made Easy: \br A Practitioner's Guide to the RUP \br \nospell{Per Kroll} et al.}}

\section[CMMI]{TS at CMMI}

\plush[4]{\innoCite{books/cmmi}{Detailed design is focused on software product component development.
