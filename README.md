There are slides for my lectures about Software Systems Design,
which were presented to 3rd year BSc students at Innopolis University
in 2021. Videos are in [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaIsQH4uc08woJKRAA7mmjs9fU0jeKjjM).

To compile everything just run:

```bash
$ make
```

To clean everything up, do:

```
$ make clean
```

You need to have
LaTeX,
[`aspell`](http://aspell.net/),
[`texsc`](https://rubygems.org/gems/texsc),
and
[`texqc`](https://rubygems.org/gems/texqc)
installed.
